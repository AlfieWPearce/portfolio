# Alfie Pearce - Portfolio Website

A scrolling constellation of the things I've made, and the paths that led me here.
Welcome to the source code for my personal developer portfolio.
This site is designed as a quiet, wandering journey - a drifting starfield backdrop, crisp sections, a floating index to guide you, and a collection of my projects, from early experiments to the present day.

## What this Site is

A simple, elegant (hopefully) portfolio built with:

- A vertical nav bar
- A p5.js nebula background
- Clean CSS architecture
  No bloated frameworks. No noise.

## Tech Stack

- **HTML5** - Structure
- **CSS3** - Layout, Grid, Theming
- **JavaScript** - scroll logic, nav behaviour, background
- **p5.js** - animated stars and nebula backdrop

> Build small. Build honesty. Make it visually appealing and a pleasure to read.
> This site is designed to age well - with subtle colours, spacious spacing, minimal scripts, and ideas allowed to stand on their own.
