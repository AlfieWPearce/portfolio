					The future is clever, but the past is wise - I try to borrow

				<h2>Manifesto</h2>
				<p>
					I build with intent in a world addicted to haste.<br />
					I question loudly, create boldly, and honour the craft that
					came before me. <br />
					Innovation is my mischief; clarity is my compass.<br />
					What I make, I make to last.
				</p>
			</section>

				<h2>Main Projects</h2>
			</section>
			<section class="projects left">
				<h2>Solar System</h2>
				<p>
					A real-time orbital model built with Three.js, simulating
					gravitation mechanics using Newtonian physics.<br />
					I designed the experience to feel tactile and explanatory -
					planets drifting, shadows shifting, and moting responding
					subtly to user input. The project taught me how to blend
					science, maths, and visual storytelling into an interactive
					environemt.<br />
					This is a passion project of mine and as such will be
					costantly evolving.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section class="projects right light">
				<h2>Bridge</h2>
				<p>
					A full digital version of the card game Bridge, built from
					scratch - complete with auction logic, scoring rules, and
					animated card mechanics.<br />
					The project pushed me into deeper algorithmic thinking and
					state management, as well as clean UI design inspired by
					physical playing cards.<br />
					This is my Computer Science Coursework - and as such, the
					code will not be available until August 2026.
				</p>

				<h2>Recent Projects</h2>
			</section>
			<section class="projects">
				<h2>Ghost Ink Inspector</h2>
				<p>
					A small experiment that shows hidden Unicode characters
					(often found in AI responses) and allows you to copy a
					cleaned version of your text.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section class="projects lefter">
				<h2>Regex Tester</h2>
				<p>
					A fast, lightweight regular-expression playground for
					testing patterns live.<br />
					My goal was clarity: instant feedback, clean visuals, and no
					distractions - something that I wanted, while learning regex
					myself.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section class="projects righter">
				<h2>Email Harvester</h2>
				<p>
					A demostration tool showing how web-scraping algorithms work
					(and can gather OSINT) - built purely for learning and
					teaching cybersecuity and OSINT principles.<br />
					It reinforced the importance of ethical coding and secure
					web practices.
				</p>
				<p class="disclaimer">
					DISCLAIMER: This is an educational tool use only for
					educational purposes
				</p>
			</section>
			<section class="projects right light">
				<h2>Draughts</h2>
				<p>
					A straightforward implementation of the classic board game
					(aka Checkers in the USA), focuing on smooth gameplay, clean
					logic, and simple animations.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section class="projects left">
				<h2>Deadwood</h2>
				<p>
					A narrative puzzle-based game, where the player must repair
					a broken car in order to escape a quiet, eerie woodland
					<br />
					An early exploration of branching dialogue, inventory
					systems, and environemtal storytelling. <br />
					Made for a college project with a friend (Amelia Botnari)
					and achieved 2nd place!
				</p>
			</section>

			<section class="projects title">
				<h2>Old Projects</h2>
				<p>
					Games and utilities made by me a long time ago, when I was
					11 or younger as a rule (in Scratch, I couldn't gain access
					to many others)<br />
					The dates are weird - some of these I had to port or edit
					for them to be useable.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section class="projects">
				<h2>Asteroid Shooter</h2>
				<p>
					An arcade-style shooter created when I was very young -
					chaotic, colourful, and full of energy.<br />
					You control a space-ship that has to destroy asteroids and
					survive. How long can you live?
				</p>
			</section>
			<section class="projects lefter">
				<h2>3D Raycaster</h2>
				<p>
					My first experiment with 3D rendering concepts - a simple
					Doom-like engine using raycasting techniques.<br />
					Writing it taught me that "fake 3D" can be far more clever
					that i looks.<br />
					This was inspired by games like Doom, Moon, and Wolfenstein.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section class="projects righter">
				<h2>Maze Generator</h2>
				<p>
					An implementation of recursive backtracking to generate
					perfect mazes - a small project with a surprising sense of
					life as the passageways carve themselves into existence.<br />
					There is also the choice to set a blacklisted object for the
					maze to not be generated in.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section class="projects">
				<h2>Firework Simulator</h2>
				<p>
					My first attempt at a simple particle simulator. It imitates
					a firework display and creates sound as well as visuals.
				</p>

				<h2>Work Experience</h2>
				<ul class="columns">
					<li class="column">
						<h3>HEALTH UNLIDDED - Volunteer Data Scientist</h3>
						<p>
							I researched and analysed healthcare data to
							support healthcare, transforming raw numbers
							into stories that mattered. My work
							contributed to two published reports:

								>Missed Appointments, Missed
								Lives</a

						<p>
							The role sharpened my analytical abilities
							and showed me the power of clear
							communication in shaping real-world
							decisions.

						<h3>
							THE EXCHANGE, Tiptree - Work Experience
							Placement
						</h3>
						<p>
							A crash course in real responsibility: I
							prepared food and drinks, served customers,
							and handled transactions with accuracy
							during busy hours.<br />
							I also supported the office with financial
							and administrative tasks, gaining hands-on
							experience with Microsoft Excel and the
							wider 365 Suite.
