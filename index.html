				<h2>Manifesto</h2>
				<p>
					I build with intent in a world addicted to haste.<br />
					I question loudly, create boldly, and honour the craft that
					came before me. <br />
					Innovation is my mischief; clarity is my compass.<br />
					What I make, I make to last.

				<section>
					<h2 class="project-title">Solar System</h2>
					<p class="project-description">
						A real-time orbital model built with Three.js,
						simulating gravitation mechanics using Newtonian
						physics.<br />
						I designed the experience to feel tactile and
						explanatory - planets drifting, shadows shifting,
						and moting responding subtly to user input. The
						project taught me how to blend science, maths, and
						visual storytelling into an interactive
						environemt.<br />
						This is a passion project of mine and as such will
						be costantly evolving.

				class="section project-link projects right light"

				<section>
					<h2 class="project-title">Bridge</h2>
					<p class="project-description">
						A full digital version of the card game Bridge,
						built from scratch - complete with auction logic,
						scoring rules, and animated card mechanics.<br />
						The project pushed me into deeper algorithmic
						thinking and state management, as well as clean UI
						design inspired by physical playing cards.<br />
						This is my Computer Science Coursework - and as
						such, the code will not be available until August
						2026.

			<a href="https://github.com/AlfieWPearce/Boids/" class="section project-link projects">
				<section>
					<h2 class="project-title">Boids</h2>
					<p class="project-description">
						An experiment with the idea of Boids<br />
						Boids is a simple simulation that models the movement of birds in a flock, but can be used for many things, including and not limited to UAVs and UGVs.<br />
						This will likely become the background of the portfolio temporarily

					<h2 class="project-title">Ghost Ink Inspector</h2>
					<p class="project-description">
						A small experiment that shows hidden Unicode

				<section>
					<h2 class="project-title">Regex Tester</h2>
					<p class="project-description">
						A fast, lightweight regular-expression playground
						for testing patterns live.<br />
						My goal was clarity: instant feedback, clean
						visuals, and no distractions - something that I
						wanted, while learning regex myself.

					<p class="project-description">
						A demostration tool showing how web-scraping
						algorithms work (and can gather OSINT) - built
						purely for learning and teaching cybersecuity and
						OSINT principles.<br />
						It reinforced the importance of ethical coding and
						secure web practices.

						A narrative puzzle-based game, where the player must
						repair a broken car in order to escape a quiet,
						eerie woodland
						<br />
						An early exploration of branching dialogue,
						inventory systems, and environemtal storytelling.
						<br />
						Made for a college project with a friend (Amelia
						Botnari) and achieved 2nd place!

				<h2>Old Projects</h2>
				<p>
					Games and utilities made by me a long time ago, when I was
					11 or younger as a rule (in Scratch, I couldn't gain access
					to many others)<br />
					The dates are weird - some of these I had to port or edit
					for them to be useable.

					<h2 class="project-title">Asteroid Shooter</h2>
					<p class="project-description">
						An arcade-style shooter created when I was very
						young - chaotic, colourful, and full of energy.<br />
						You control a space-ship that has to destroy
						asteroids and survive. How long can you live?

					<h2 class="project-title">3D Raycaster</h2>
					<p class="project-description">
						My first experiment with 3D rendering concepts - a
						simple Doom-like engine using raycasting
						techniques.<br />
						Writing it taught me that "fake 3D" can be far more
						clever that it looks.<br />
						This was inspired by games like Doom, Moon, and
						Wolfenstein.

					<h2 class="project-title">Maze Generator</h2>
					<p class="project-description">
						An implementation of recursive backtracking to
						generate perfect mazes - a small project with a
						surprising sense of life as the passageways carve
						themselves into existence.<br />
						There is also the choice to set a blacklisted object
						for the maze to not be generated in.
